# Kangxi Radicals Cheatsheet & Flashcards

This is a small collection of programs for generating useful artifacts related to [Kangxi radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_radicals). It also ignores variants that aren't very common. The cheatsheet includes all the radicals, but the cards will ignore those radicals that I don't think are important.

## Commands
